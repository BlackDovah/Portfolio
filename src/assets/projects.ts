This project that I made during a backend development course taken with IBM on coursera is a book review website where users can create an account and review books. The account information is saved in a users array, and is always referenced if the user tries to login to determin if an account does exist or not, and a token is created for authenticated users that have an account to allow them to access authenticated user only functions that allows them to make or delete reviews. Non-registerd users have access to limited functions, that allows them to browse books, and view their reviews, but without the ability to leave their own reviews.",
